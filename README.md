# About Me
This is a simple HTML page that introduces me, SamAddy, an engineer who loves the Bible, technology, and nature. The page contains several sections, including an introduction, a section about my projects, a section for some of my favorite quotes and a contact information. The page is served [here](https://github.com/SamAddy/the-anchor-man/blob/main/anchor.jpg?raw=true).

## Semantic-HTML
The page is built using semantic HTML elements to help provide structure and meaning to the content. For example, the `header`, `main`, and `footer` elements are used to represent the header, main content, and footer sections of the page, respectively.

To ensure that the page is accessible to everyone, the appropriate WAI-ARIA attributes, such as `role` and `aria-label`, have been added to the HTML elements. These attributes provide additional context for screen readers and other assistive technologies to understand the structure and purpose of the page.

In addition to using semantic HTML, I also tried to make the webpage visually appealing by using lines as dividers between the sections. No CSS was used in the creation of this page.

Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own personal webpage, and don't forget to experiment with different HTML elements and WAI-ARIA attributes to make your content more accessible!
